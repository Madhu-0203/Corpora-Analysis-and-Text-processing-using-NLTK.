# Corpora-Analysis-and-Text-processing-using-NLTK.
In this project, I worked on Corpora Analysis &amp; Processing Texts using NLTK package.

There are 3 Parts: 
First Question, works on the Brown Corpus: 
        We explored the categories, fileIDs, sentences, words, POS tags, frequency of the words per category, etc...
        
Second Question, works on Raw Corpus & POS tags: 
        We explored a Raw corpus by striping the paragraphs -> sentences -> words. Further we tagged all the words w.r.t. it's POS. 
        
Third Question, works on a Movie Description: 
        We started converting into lower case, then performed Sentence and Word segmentation on it. Further we removed the stop words and explored stemming, lemmatization and POS taggers.
